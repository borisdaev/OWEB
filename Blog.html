                <p>Macedonia will go to a major soccer tournament for the first time in its history after team captain Goran Pandev's goal gave the Balkan nation a 1-0 win away over Georgia in their Euro 2020 qualifying playoff final on November 12.

                    Pandev scored in the 56th minute in Tbilisi, allowing the country to secure their place in the finals of the postponed European Championship, which is now set to go ahead in June and July next year.</p>
